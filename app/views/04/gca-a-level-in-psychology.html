          <p>Psychology is the study of behaviour. Psychologists generate ideas and explanations for different behaviours, and test those ideas using a variety of research techniques. By studying Psychology you will learn about a wide variety of behaviours and look at landmark pieces of research in the field.</p> 
          <p>You will often take part in recreations of these pieces of research so that you develop a deep understanding of the research process used in Psychology and the ability to evaluate this process thoroughly. </p>
          <p>Examples of the behaviours studied include: Criminal behaviour, memory, social influence, plasticity of the brain and mental illness.</p> 
          <p>Skills developed in Psychology include designing and carrying out research using scientific principles, analysing and interpreting data to reach conclusions and critical analysis and evaluation of research and its conclusions. </p>
          <p>You will also consider how understanding of behaviour developed through research can be applied to real life situations. An A l.evel in Psychology provides a firm foundation for further study and employment. It can lead onto a wide variety of degree courses as the skills of evaluation and critical analysis are very important skills in all degree level courses. </p>
          <p>Many students choose to study Psychology at university and this can lead onto roles as a practicing psychologist in many diverse areas, such as mental health, NHS, business, sport, counselling, the police and prison service and education. </p>
